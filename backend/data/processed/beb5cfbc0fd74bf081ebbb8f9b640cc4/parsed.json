As codebases grow and change, manual documentation becomes impractical. CodeIQ is an Agentic AI System that automates the documentation process by analyzing code, adapting to chan",
    "ges in the codebase and presenting information in a way that's easier to understand for different types of users — all with minimal manual effort. 3 SFIT- IT department CodeIQ: An Agentic AI System for Automated,Context-Aware Code Documentation Need of the Project 1. In modern software development, high-quality documentation is crucial for maintainability, collaboration, and developer onboarding. 2. Evolving software projects often suffer from outdated or missing documentation, making the code hard to understand, debug, and maintain. 3. As software systems grow in size and complexity, maintaining up-to-date documentation becomes increasingly difficult. 4. There is a growing need for intelligent, role-specific, automated systems that can generate and maintain documentation contextually and dynamically. 4 SFIT- IT department CodeIQ: An Agentic AI System for Automated,Context-Aware Code Documentation Review of literature Sr. Title of Methodology Analysis/Limitation No paper 1.

Introduces runtime-aware documentation by analyzing function ⚫ behavior through controlled execution traces. Ensures factual correctness using a hybrid verifier that combines static ⚫ validation with dynamic trace matching. Customizes documentation output for different roles (developer, tester, ⚫ DevOps) through a role-semantic docstring generator. Tracks and adapts to codebase changes via a Git-integrated history-aware ⚫ Searcher Agent. Produces structured, versioned, and readable documentation using a ⚫ coordinated writer and orchestration workflow. 10 Scope of project Language Focus The system will b",
